The diagram above is a graphical representation of the infrastructure we will be setting up. We will be hosting our static website content on Amazon S3 bucket. Then, we will setup a custom domain name with AWS Route53 as our DNS, create SSL certificate to secure our content and finally, configure Cloudfront CDN for content caching and distribution. Navigate to `static-website.md` to Begin. Happy Learning!!!
